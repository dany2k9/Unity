This page lets you create HTML by entering text in a simple format that's easy to read and write.

  - Type Markdown text in the left window
  - See the HTML in the right

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site] [1]:

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable 
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

This document is written in Markdown; you can see the plain-text version on the left.  To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.  You can see a Markdown syntax guide by switching the right-hand window from *Preview* to *Syntax Guide*.

Showdown is a Javascript port of Markdown.  You can get the full [source code] by clicking on the version number at the bottom of the page.

**Start with a [blank page] or edit this document in the left window.**

## Syntax highlighting

When combined with [highlight.js][] this starts looking as a kind of IDE :-)

HTML:

    <h1>HTML code</h1>
    <p class="some">This is an example</p>

Python:

    def func():
      for i in [1, 2, 3]:
        print "%s" % i

```csharp
  using System.Collections;
  using System.Collections.Generic;
  using UnityEngine;

  [CreateAssetMenu(fileName = "BiomeAttributes", menuName = "MinecraftTutorial/Biome Attribute")]
  public class BiomeAttributes : ScriptableObject {

      public string biomeName;

      public int solidGroundHeight;
      public int terrainHeight;
      public float terrainScale;

      public Lode[] lodes;

  }

  [System.Serializable]
  public class Lode {

      public string nodeName;
      public byte blockID;
      public int minHeight;
      public int maxHeight;
      public float scale;
      public float threshold;
      public float noiseOffset;


  }
